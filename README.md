### Project Feature Creep:
* User Registration & Login & Authentication
* Secure / Encrypted Messages

* Message Tracking - Keep a history on the server of the messages
  * Do something with the message history like collect a running total bill or total characters/tokens sent
* Could do something else instead of messages, like files
